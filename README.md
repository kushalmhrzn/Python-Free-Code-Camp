# Python-Free-Code-Camp
This is the python learning form the frecodecamp

Day 1:
To install Python on Windows, follow these steps:
- Go to https://www.python.org/, and hover over “Downloads“. You should see a modal that says "Download for Windows" and a download button with the current version of Python.
- Click on the version number, and you'll start downloading a Windows executable (.exe) file automatically.
- Once you've finished downloading the Python installer for Windows, double-click on it, and follow the instructions.
- When you see the option Add python.exe to Path, check that option, then click Install Now. Doing that will make things easier for you later.
